Patients experience less pain, shorter hospital stays, and can return to normal activities much sooner than with traditional open-heart surgery.</p>
      
      <h3>Robotic-Assisted Surgery</h3>
      <p>Robotic systems have revolutionized cardiac surgery by providing surgeons with enhanced precision, flexibility, and control. The da Vinci Surgical System, for example, allows surgeons to perform complex procedures through tiny incisions with instruments that can rotate in ways the human hand cannot. This technology has been particularly beneficial for delicate procedures like mitral valve repair.</p>
      
      <h3>Transcatheter Procedures</h3>
      <p>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has transformed the treatment of aortic stenosis, especially in high-risk patients. This procedure involves replacing the aortic valve through a catheter inserted into the groin, eliminating the need for open-heart surgery. Similar approaches are being developed for other heart valve conditions.</p>
      
      <h3>Artificial Intelligence in Cardiac Care</h3>
      <p>AI is making significant inroads in cardiac care, from diagnostic imaging to surgical planning. Machine learning algorithms can analyze echocardiograms and other imaging studies to detect heart conditions with greater accuracy than traditional methods. AI is also being used to predict patient outcomes and personalize treatment plans.</p>
      
      <h3>The Future of Cardiac Surgery</h3>
      <p>Looking ahead, we can expect continued innovation in cardiac surgery. Researchers are exploring tissue engineering to create living heart valves, advanced imaging techniques for real-time surgical guidance, and personalized medicine approaches based on a patient's genetic profile. These developments promise to further improve outcomes and quality of life for heart patients.</p>
      
      <p>As these technologies continue to evolve, the focus remains on providing the best possible care with the least invasive approach. The future of cardiac surgery is not just about technological advancement, but about patient-centered care that improves both quantity and quality of life.</p>

        <li>Within 20 minutes: Heart rate drops to normal</li>
        <li>Within 12 hours: Carbon monoxide level in blood drops to normal</li>
        <li>Within 1 year: Risk of coronary heart disease is half that of a smoker</li>
        <li>Within 5 years: Risk of mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder cancers is cut in half</li>
        <li>Within 10 years: Risk of dying from lung cancer is about half that of a person who is still smoking</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Healthy Diet</h3>
      <p>A plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can reduce cancer risk. Key components include:</p>
      
      <h4>Cruciferous Vegetables</h4>

    title: "Rehabilitation After Surgery: A Roadmap to Recovery",
    excerpt: "A comprehensive guide to post-surgical rehabilitation, including timelines, exercises, and tips for a successful recovery.",
    content: `
      <p>Rehabilitation is a critical component of the recovery process after surgery. This guide provides a roadmap for patients navigating the post-surgical period, including what to expect, key milestones, and strategies to optimize recovery.</p>
      
      <h3>The Phases of Surgical Recovery</h3>
      <p>Surgical recovery typically occurs in distinct phases, each with specific goals and interventions:</p>
      
      <h4>Phase 1: Immediate Postoperative Period (0-2 weeks)</h4>
      <p>This initial phase focuses on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pain management</li>
        <li>Wound healing</li>
        <li>Preventing complications (blood clots, infection)</li>
        <li>Early mobilization</li>
      </ul>
      <p>During this phase, patients typically remain in the hospital or a skilled nursing facility. Physical therapy begins with gentle movements and progresses as tolerated.</p>
      
      <h4>Phase 2: Early Recovery (2-6 weeks)</h4>
      <p>As patients transition home, the focus shifts to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increasing independence with daily activities</li>
